These are the minimum requirements for the project at the time of writing:
- An operating system that we support
  - Windows 10 / 11
  - A Linux distro that is still atleast in LTS (we build with Ubuntu 20.04)
- x86-64 CPU with **AVX** support.
  - Most, if not all, 64-bit CPUs should work. OpenGOAL has a very small CPU footprint, so most modern CPUs will run the game fine.
- Graphics card that supports **OpenGL 4.3**.
  - If you have an AMD Radeon card, updating your AMD drivers to at least version 22.7.1 is recommended. Older driver versions or other AMD cards will be running at a disadvantage.
- At least 2 GiB of available RAM for the game is recommended.
- You might experience slower loads with a hard drive compared to an SSD.
