# OpenGOAL Reference

This is the main documentation for the OpenGOAL language. It's designed to be read in order to learn OpenGOAL. **It does not explain the OpenGOAL kernel or state system.**

The syntax descriptions uses these rules:
- Something `[in-brackets]` is optional and can be left out.
- Something like `[:type type-name]` means there is an optional named argument.
  - It can be used like `:type type-name`, replacing `type-name` with what you want, or left out entirely.
- When there are multiple choices, they are separated by `|`. Example: `#t|#f` is either `#t` or `#f`.
- `...` means more of the thing before can be included. Example `(f arg...)` can have multiple arguments.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
