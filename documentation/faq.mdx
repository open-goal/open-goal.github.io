# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### How do I play it?

:::danger
You will need your own legitimately obtained copy of the original game. The Jak games are not rare and can be found used for very affordable prices at a variety of second-hand and online stores.

[Example _Jak and Daxter_ listing (THIS IS NOT AN ENDORSEMENT).](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=jak&_sacat=0)
:::

We encourage you to use our Launcher which simplifies the installation and updating process. You can find a link to get this from the homepage at: [https://opengoal.dev](https://opengoal.dev).

Alternatively, you can use the latest release from our GitHub repo https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/releases and provide the path to your ISO like so - `./extractor[.exe] <path-to-iso>`. Once this completes, you should be able to run `gk[.exe]` to start the game.

We support _all retail versions_ of the original _Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy_ and _Jak II_ for PS2. (There is no planend support for PS3, PS4 or PS5 versions.) For more details on how your version of the games matter, see [this page](./usage/game_versions.md). <span className="reddishColor">**There is no planned support for early builds, demos or non PS2-versions.**</span>

### What are the minimum requirements?

<Requirements />

#### Will AVX always be required?

At this time, **yes**.

AVX instructions are used for basically all vector math computations used in rendering, collision detection, and other game logic.

### Where can I donate?

For several reasons, we are **not** accepting financial donations of any kind.

### Why was this project started?

First and foremost, for fun and the challenge. We are primarily interested in learning how the original games were made, and understanding the technology behind them. The end result of a working PC port that can potentially support mod and such is very motivating and exciting -- but ultimately secondary.

### Is this project legal?

Yes.

### My antivirus claims it's a virus, what gives?

This is caused by a false-positive detection, which we can do nothing about. If you have any doubts, our code and release process is entirely open-source and can be audited.

### How finished is the project?

_Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy_ and _Jak II_ are at a stage where they are feature complete and bug free on the default settings. _Jak II_ is as of writing still in beta mainly due to a few audio and graphics issues, which shouldn't get in the way of completing the game. _Jak 3_ is in very early stages, come back later!

### When is _Jak 3_ / _Jak X_?

Please remember that we do this work for free, in our spare time, when we feel like it. There are no rigid timelines that we make for ourselves, things will be done when they are done.

- _Jak 3_ is in early stages, do not hold your breath on this being complete within atleast a year.
- As of now, it's unsure whether _Jak X_ will be decompiled. Never forget you can still use an emulator to play these games.

### Will you decompile Daxter or The Lost Frontier?

No, these games run on completely different engines and were not made by Naughty Dog.

### Will you decompile Ratchet & Clank? Don't they share the same engine?

No. _Ratchet & Clank_ does not use Naughty Dog's engine and was not written in GOAL, it was developed by a completely different team of people. As stated in staff roll for the _Ratchet & Clank_ games, only the background renderers use Naughty Dog technology. Our work is not transferrable to that series.

### Will you decompile [_insert non-Jak game here_]?

No, we are no where near done with Jak 3 yet, and other than experience not much is transferable from this project to others. The Jak games present a very unique set of challenges that we have solved that other games do not -- similarly other games pose entirely new sets of challenges.
<!-- https://discord.com/channels/756287461377703987/801612566874554399/1221207684074963014 -->

Most importantly, we are motivated on working on Jak, not other games. Those other games likely already have small niche communities plugging away at things in the background just like we were.

### Is there support for raytracing?

No. Implementing raytracing would require a very massive art overhaul which is far outside the scope of this project.

## Game Info

### Does the game have differences? I don't remember these options!

We have added a plethora of options to the game settings (and removed some that didn't make sense) so that you can have a more up to date experience, or a more PS2-like experience if you decide. It is up to you! There are also a bunch of extra goodies and added secrets to find out. We are aiming to keep the core gameplay (controls, physics, behaviors, etc.) identical however, so if you find any issues or differences with this then do not hesitate to tell us about it.

### Will there be bug fixes to the game?

The original game had a few issues of varying severity - from progress softlocks to crashing - that we have patched or are aiming to patch. The complexity of these issues is varying (if they were simple to reproduce and fix, Naughty Dog likely would have done it), but so far we have fixed more than a couple of issues that could crash the game.

### Will there be mod support?

In the future yes! We intend to make it as easy as we can to make your own code or import graphics for the game. In the meanwhile several mods can already be tried out using the unofficial mod launcher, found at [https://jakmods.dev/](https://jakmods.dev/).

### Will you support pressure sensitivity?

No. Pressure sensitivity is the possibility of a few controllers such as DualShock 2, DualShock 3 to detect differences in the amount of force applied to them, as opposed to binary inputs (e.g. "pressed" or "not pressed"). Even though pressure sensitivity is present in the PS2 and PS3 versions (for extra jump height and controlling the zoomer), there is no plan to support this. The vast majority of controllers doesn't support this at a hardware or driver level anyway. <!--In the future, we possibly support an option to use triggers to accelerate combined with pressure sensitivity.-->

### Will you support ARM platforms (such as Android, Apple Silicon, Nintendo Switch, etc.)?

Currently, it's not planned. Supporting ARM platforms requires rewriting our own GOAL compiler, which as of writing only supports x86-64 platforms. In the current core-development team no one has interest in undertaking this work, but if you do take interest in compilers and extending ours to support ARM, ask for more details in the [development channel](https://discord.com/channels/756287461377703987/756287461830688810) on Discord.

### The launcher requests an ISO. Where can I find them?

You can extract the isos from a physical copy of the game for PS2, as described on the [Installation page](https://opengoal.dev/docs/usage/installation/). We do not provide them ourselves and will not share download links or allow others to share them on our servers/websites.

### Where can I find HD textures?

The textures are copyrighted material. We do not promote downloading a texture pack if such exists, since it wouldn't respect the copyrights.

### Where are my saves?

The saves can be found in `AppData\Roaming\OpenGOAL\jak1` on Windows, or in `~/.config/OpenGOAL/jak1` on Linux. In very old versions, the saves were in your user folder, in a folder named `OpenGOAL`.

## Troubleshooting

### I am getting "illegal operation"/"illegal instruction" errors when running the game or tools.

Make sure your CPU supports AVX. If it does, please contact us in the support channel of the discord server and we can try to help.

### The game is really slow.

Your GPU might be too weak. Some of our rendering code is a bit inefficient and can still be improved, but you should expect significantly better performance than for example running via an emulator. Therefore, things might get better overtime -- or your hardware is just plain too limiting.

### The game crashed!!

Curses! Contact us in the [help channel](https://discord.com/channels/756287461377703987/1019706639810580553) on the discord server and tell us about it! Post a support package as well (see [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5nnl9Av09Zg) how to generate one). If you're using a Launcher, it can be generated under the help section. Make sure you tell us exactly how the crash happened and what settings you were using.

### My controller doesn't work!

Our controller handling does need some work, but generally speaking any controller defined in this database should be supported https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB You can try the following until support improves:

- Make sure you only have 1 controller plugged in at a time to ensure that one is used.
- Try leveraging Steam to get the controller recognized. Conversely, if you have Steam or any other games that may be using your controller open, try closing them. You can also [turn off Steam Input](https://github.com/open-goal/open-goal.github.io/pull/237#discussion_r1569563834) if enabled, as it might try to make your controller function as a replacement for keyboard and mouse.
- If your controller isn't in the DB above, you should follow the steps there to make a mapping for your controller.
- Try using third-party software or kernel drivers for your particular controller (i.e. [DualSenseX](https://dualsensex.com/), [DS4Windows](https://ds4-windows.com/), [DsHidMini](https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/DsHidMini/), [xpadneo](https://atar-axis.github.io/xpadneo/)).

### I have a black screen

A number of players have encountered black screens that are hard to reproduce. We need as much as information on this issue to solve it, so if you encounter it, please report it! See the section below on how to get in touch to let us know.

### I am having some other issue or found a bug with the game/tools.

First, scroll through our [issues](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/issues) page to make sure that your issue hasn't been reported already. If it hasn't, feel free to open up a new issue, or report it to us directly. Make sure you provide reproduction steps! We can't always guess why things go wrong.

## Technical Questions

### How is this project possible?

Naughty Dog created a custom programming language called [GOAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp), along with a compiler for it. GOAL makes up 98% of all the code in _Jak and Daxter_, and the GOAL compiler does not have the same amount of optimizations as C or C++ compilers have, which means that the compiler often times left specific instructions that denote some specific kind of control flow, which lets us piece back the original structure of the code accurately for about 99% of the functions in the game. Nearly every type in GOAL also has an autogenerated debug `inspect` method, which prints all of a type's fields by default. These `inspect` methods can tell us what fields were in the type, at what offset, and what their type was.

### I'm a developer, how can I help?

Our project moves very fast so it's hard to give an answer here that will remain true for weeks let alone months.

Some recommended steps are:

- Consult our GitHub README and [get the project setup](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-a-development-environment).
- Look through our documentation that we try to update when we get a chance.
- Look through our [issue board](https://github.com/orgs/open-goal/projects) on the github repository and see if you feel comfortable tackling a problem.

Aside from the OpenGOAL source code for the games, our codebase is almost entirely C++ with the exception of some throwaway scripts written in Python or what have you. Of course you will eventually have to understand OpenGOAL, our flavour of the Naughty Dog language, as the game is by-and-large _not rewritten_ in C++.
