<!-- ## Known Issues -->

## Launcher

### Build new AppImage format <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/853"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/858"/>

Upgrades our Tauri version to support portable AppImages.

### Disable content selection in sidebar <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/862"/>

Fixes minor bug where you could highlight unintended parts of the UI.

### Restore playtime feature <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/872"/>

Restores a feature to track playtime per game, which was inadvertently removed during code cleanup.

### Support window resizing & allow Linux users to change install directory <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/856"/>

Now that the CSS is responsive, we can allow for the launcher window to be resized (e.g. fullscreen on Steamdeck). Also fixed an issue where Linux users couldn't change their installation directory.

### Improve support package output <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/875"/>

Improves the accuracy of installation metadata collected for the support package, which users can provide to developers to get help troubleshooting.

### Restore changelog page <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/873"/>

Adds back the page detailing what has changed when new updates are available. This also fixes responsive issues with the "Update Available" header positioning.

### Replace `svelte-navigator` with `sv-router` <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/874"/>

Replaces the deprecated `svelte-navigator` with the more modern `sv-router`, which has some new features and a much nicer reactive model.

### Correct header version display for mods <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/879"/>

Properly distinguishes between vanilla and mod versions in the header.

![](./img/mod_version.png)

### Texture Pack / Mod feature cleanup <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/886"/>

Fixes a bunch of typescript errors and refactored Texture Packs and Mods into isolated components.

### Fix local mod installation <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/880"/>

Fixes an issue where mods could no longer be installed from a local release package.

### Fix offline mod support <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/848"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/887"/>

Fixes an issue where already-installed mods could not be played while offline. The launcher will now cache metadata about mods during installation, and will fall back to this if the information cannot be fetched from the mod list source (i.e. while offline).

### Fix brief UI flashes while navigating <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/885"/>

Fixes an issue where previous component state could be briefly visible while naviating between pages.

Adds the zoom blur effect used for in cutscenes and for a few weapons:
<ReactPlayer controls url={require("./video/zoom_blur.mp4").default} />

Adds the color filter effect used in Misson Failed screen:
<ReactPlayer controls url={require("./video/color_filter.mp4").default} />

### Fix crash when entering Freedom League HQ <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/4035"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/4038"/>

Fixes some issues that would lead to a crash when entering the Freedom League HQ.

### Fix crash from VAG out-of-bounds access <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/4040"/>

Fixes an issue where all stereo VAG commands would write to an out-of-bounds array element and corrupt the whole VAG queue list. This was the cause of various sound-related crashes, such as when using Light Jak Freeze.

Adds renderer support for modifying brightness and contrast, a new feature added to the graphics options in Jak 3.

Fixes an issue where the sandstorm in the wasteland had overly-aggressive particle effects and pushback effects on Jak. Players may have noticed this issue in the PS3 port, as it occurs because the newer console could maintain a better framerate than the PS2.
