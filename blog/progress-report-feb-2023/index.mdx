## Jak 1 and General Fixes

### Rock Village IL Speedrun Fixed <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2187"/>

Minor fix for this IL where the `Rock Village` hud text was not marked as seen in advance.

### Hungarian Text Translation <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2141"/>

Hungarian translations for the text have been added.

### Speedrun Autosplitter - Scout Fly / Orb Counts <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2192"/>

This month the speedrun autosplitter should now have a bunch of new options for splitting when you collect all the orbs in a particular area.

### Easier Speedrun Menu Button Combo <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2196"/>

There is an alternative button combo for bringing up the menu added last month - while holding `L1 + R1 + X`, press `SELECT`. The original combo (pressing `START` instead) still works too.

### Better Setting Documentation <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/open-goal.github.io/pull/119"/>

The documentation for the game's settings has been improved [here](/docs/usage/settings/).

### Credits to use the Audio Language <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2220"/>

The credits in Jak 1 will now use the configured Audio Language instead of the text language.

### Speedrun Category Extensions <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2195"/>

Several new speedrunning category extensions have been added to the Speedrun Menu, including NG+, Hub 1/2/3 100%, and All Cutscenes.

### Launcher Improvements Coming <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/launcher/pull/104"/>

This work wasn't done in time to be released this month confidently, but work is being finalized to make the Launcher:

- easier to install and manage `jak-project` versions
- easier to ask for help when things go wrong
- overall resolve bugs and issues that have been going on for a while

## Jak 2

### BLERC Support <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2179"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2163"/>

This adds support for blend-shapes to Jak 2 -- which makes all the cutscenes much less stiff and awkward.

### Hovering Enemies <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2028"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2198"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2209"/>

As mentioned last month, there was still more `nav` related code to work on. This month, we finished the code involved with allowing enemies to hover and fly around. This was blocking a few select missions, which now work!

### Onin Minigame <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2188"/>

The best minigame is now working! This had been waiting to be tested for a long time due to some issues that needed to be solved in the decompiler, once those were fixed, no issues.

### Functioning Traffic <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2191"/>

The traffic and vehicle code has sucked to get decompiled. Too many custom types had to be invented to hack around things for the time being, but in any case, traffic and vehicles are now finally functional. If you've played Jak 2 before, this also opened the doors for working on a ton of missions which were previously blocked.

### Citizens <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2194"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2230"/>

The citizens in the city now also function in addition to the traffic. This same PR also finished up some remaining metalhead and guard code.

### Seal at Water Slums <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2199"/>

Everyone's favourite mission now works.

### Lightning Renderer <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2203"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2204"/>

The renderer to handle the lightning was spiked out this month. It still has some issues, namely that all lightning is red when most times it should be blue.

### Krew Fight <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2208"/>

In addition to the castle level mostly working, so too does the final fight.

### Per-Prototype Visibility <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2212"/>

Jak 2 adds a feature to disable protos in TIE. It's used to hide things like steps for a future mission in ruins, and also to hide the static version of the tower when it switches to the merc version for the cutscene:

### Meet Brutter <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2218"/>

As mentioned, with the vehicles now working, we can start to work on missions that needed them. First of which to share is the `meet-brutter` mission:

### Protect Kor and Kid & Intercept Tanker <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2219"/>

These missions are now working with the decompilation of the kid / croca-dog / ashelin related files.

### Fog <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2223"/>

Jak 2 has been lacking fog for a while, there are still some spots where we think it's off, but this is a lot better.

### Palace Cable <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2222"/>

The palace cable mission is now working, it's got the annoying elevator bug (elevators always leave Jak behind) which makes the beginning of the mission a bit awkward though.

### Sprite Glow Renderer <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2232"/>

Another new renderer for Jak 2 -- this one handles all of the glowing light effects.

Warp gates are now functional.

### Sewer Escort <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2279"/>

The sewer escort mission is mostly working now. This was one of the last big chunks of gameplay code left to decompile, with only a handful of files left to go now.

## General Tooling

### Automatic Documentation Generation <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2214"/> <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/open-goal.github.io/pull/120"/>

No good codebase is complete without decent documentation to go along with it. If you are familiar with other languages, you may have heard of JavaDocs, Doxygen, etc.

We now generate documentation from the docstrings in the OpenGOAL source files that gets bundled with the website which you can find [here](https://opengoal.dev/docs/source-docs/).

There are still many issues and areas that lack support end-to-end, but this is a good start that can be iterated on. It also has made other features much easier to implement in the LSP.

### Memory Footprint of goalc Reduced <PRLink href="https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project/pull/2247"/>

Some recent changes significantly reduce the amount of memory `goalc` consumes.
